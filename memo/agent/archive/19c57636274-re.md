## Summary

Implemented all 4 memo tool improvements as specified in the plan.

## Results

### Step 1: `read` subcommand (commit 7e02ccc)

- Created `scripts/memo/commands/read.ts` with `findMemoById` and `readMemo` functions
- Added `read` case to `scripts/memo.ts`
- Created `scripts/memo/__tests__/read.test.ts` (9 tests)

### Step 2: `create` stdin support (commit a317233)

- Added `body` field to `CreateOptions` in `scripts/memo/commands/create.ts`
- Added stdin reading logic to `scripts/memo.ts` create case
- Created `scripts/memo/__tests__/create.test.ts` (4 tests)

### Step 3: Help improvements (commit 5648dd5)

- Updated `printUsage()` with `read` command, stdin description, and Examples section
- Changed usage format from `npx tsx scripts/memo.ts` to `npm run memo`

### Step 4: Agent definitions (commit 5426aa7)

- Updated all 5 agent files: builder, planner, researcher, reviewer, process-engineer
- Each now has concrete memo tool commands and "Do NOT read/write memo files directly" instruction
- Role-specific notes preserved (e.g., builder's review request step)

### Changed files

- `scripts/memo/commands/read.ts` (new)
- `scripts/memo/commands/create.ts` (modified: body field)
- `scripts/memo.ts` (modified: read command, stdin support, help improvements)
- `scripts/memo/__tests__/read.test.ts` (new: 9 tests)
- `scripts/memo/__tests__/create.test.ts` (new: 4 tests)
- `.claude/agents/builder.md` (updated Memo Workflow)
- `.claude/agents/planner.md` (updated Memo Workflow)
- `.claude/agents/researcher.md` (updated Memo Workflow)
- `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` (updated Memo Workflow)
- `.claude/agents/process-engineer.md` (updated Memo Workflow)

### Validation

- All 260 tests pass (`npm test`)
- TypeScript typecheck passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- `npm run memo help` shows all commands with examples
- `npm run memo read -- --id <id>` reads memos by ID or file path
